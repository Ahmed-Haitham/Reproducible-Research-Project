# Taxi Fare Prediction

## Project Description
This project is being conducted as part of the requirements for the Reproducible Research course.

## Project Background
Taxi fare prediction entails estimating the fare amount for a taxi trip based on various factors such as pickup and drop-off locations, trip distance, time of day, and other relevant features. Given the complex interplay of spatial and temporal dynamics inherent in taxi operations, machine learning algorithms offer a powerful approach to model and predict fare amounts accurately.

## Project Overview
- **Dataset** : taxi_data, NYC geospatial data, NYCtemperature
- **Tools**:
  - **Dashboard** : Created by Streamlit
  - **ETL, Feature Engineering, Model** : conducted using Python
  - **Version Control**: Collaboration through GIT
  - **Analytics & Machine Learning**: XGboost, Random Forest
